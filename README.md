# Smart-Scan-OCR-Quickly

A web tool primarily built using Python and JavaScript which performs OCR (Optical Character Recognition) and converts text on the scanned images into plain text which user can copy, paste and edit easily. 

Adopted Axios library for making HTTP requests and FastAPI to build APIs and create the server. 

Uniqueness in the project is that multiple files can be uploaded at once and their corresponding converted texts can be downloaded in PDF format for each file uploaded. 
Also, the application is asynchronous which means the application delivers continuously updated data to the user and server doesn't get affected with high traffic.
